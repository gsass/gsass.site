I'm George Sass. I live in Somerville, MA, and am a Software Engineer (likely the relevant detail if you're here).

Over the past decade, I've developed features and internal tooling at companies of various sizes/funding stages. Right now I'm most excited about mission/impact driven companies, fun languages (enjoying TS/Go right now, what should I explore next?), and learning more about infrastructure, deployment, and observability.

I'm currently open to new opportunities. Check out my resume and portfolio to see if we might be a good fit.

I'm online at:

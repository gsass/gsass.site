# Things I've Done
_What have I done?_

As of this writing, I've been working in some software capacity for just over a decade now. It amazes me both how much I've learned in this time, and also that it's somehow been this much time. In the service of chronicling my greatest hits, and ideally telling a story with them, here's a portfolio of sorts.

## 2020 - Smartsheet: APIs, observability, and on-call improvements
## 2019 - Energysage: Marketplace modernization, and greenfield product development
## 2015 - Warby Parker: Full-stack and playing the full field
## 2013 - Vecna: Health, usability, and accessibility

In 2013, I went on to work at another company with robotics projects, but in their Electronic Health Records department\*. This was my first experience with full-stack engineering. At the time, the healthcare industry was adapting to new "Meaningful Use" federal standards for functionality, accessibility, and portability of health record systems.

I worked on two primary projects while at Vecna: one primarily front-end focused and the other almost entirely backend focused.

My team was initially charged with modernizing the frontend code (to Backbone, the state of the art at the time) so we could ensure compliance and accessibility of our Patient Dashboard and Patient Onboarding experiences. This was my first time managing dependencies across and between the client/server layers of a web application. It was also my first time being disappointed with ORM and wishing the database could do the work.



_\* Vecna worked on a rather broad suite of applicatiions at this time. Since then, the company has split into separate Robotics and Healthcare companies._ 

## 2010 - Draper Laboratory: Hello World, hello API users

In college, I was really into robots (since age 11 really, but that's not as relevant to my career story). I was lucky enough to work on a robotics project for my undergraduate capstone, and to be hired by our sponsor company to continue work on that project.

At Draper, I was responsible for developing software test fixtures for a variety of sensors. In addition, I (as my team's first dedicated software hire) was de facto responsible for estimating efforts and setting timelines for software development.

Towards the end of my time at Draper, I wrote my first microservice, in a sense: an API to stream sensor test data from our test harnesses to client machines for data acquisition and processing.

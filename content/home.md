I'm George Sass. I live in Somerville, MA, and am a Software Engineer (likely the relevant detail if you're here).

Over the past decade, I've worked at companies at various stages, in various industries. Right now I'm most excited about mission/impact driven companies, fun languages (Typescript and Go right now, but sell me on another one!), and learning new things on the job.

I'm currently open to new opportunities. Check out my resume and portfolio to see if we might be a good fit.

I'm online at:

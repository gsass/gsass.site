I'm George Sass. I live in Massachusetts, where I primarily develop software and ride bicycles.

_(Wow, this feels pretty Web 1.0, doesn't it? Should I add a construction GIF?)_

If you're here at this point, you're probably looking for my [rÃ©sumÃ©](#resume).

You may also be trying to get more info or get in touch. See:
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gsass/), which also has my resume/details
- [Github](https://github.com/gsass), where I keep personal code projects
- [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/george_sass), where I post, but often not about software

Either that or you're a search engine crawler, which is also cool.

# 👋

I'm George Sass. I live in Massachusetts, where I primarily develop software and ride bicycles.

_(Wow, this feels pretty Web 1.0, doesn't it? Should I add a construction GIF?)_

If you're here at this point, you're probably looking for my [résumé](#resume).

You may also be trying to get more info or get in touch. You can find me:

_I don't use social media much anymore. Sorry._

# ðŸ‘‹ Hey.

I'm George. I live in Massachusetts, where I develop software and ride bicycles, primarily.

_(Wow, this all feels so delightfully Web 1.0, doesn't it?)_

If you're here at this point, you're probably looking for my [rÃ©sumÃ©](#resume) or maybe my [portfolio](#portfolio). Either that or you're a search engine indexer.

If you're looking for something a bit more social, you might want to find me elsewhere, such as:
- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gsass/), where I almost never post
- [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/george_sass), where I post too much, often about software but mostly about better bike lanes/cities/futures
